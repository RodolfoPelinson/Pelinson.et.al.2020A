The goal of `PredatorIsolationComm` is to walk the user through the statistical analysis presented in:  
**"Pelinson et al 2021. Top predator introduction changes the effects of spatial isolation on freshwater community structure"**  
DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1101/857318](https://doi.org/10.1101/857318)

The analyses were divided in three different sections:

[Abundance Analysis](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/PredatorIsolationComm/blob/master/Abundance%20Analysis/Abundance-Analysis.md)  
[Community Structure](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/PredatorIsolationComm/blob/master/Community%20Structure/Community-Structure.md)  
[Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis](https://github.com/RodolfoPelinson/PredatorIsolationComm/blob/master/Spatial%20Autocorrelation%20Analysis/Spatial-Autocorrelation-Analysis.md)
